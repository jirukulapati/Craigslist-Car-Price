# Craigslist-Car-Price
Web API for predicting prices of used cars sold on Craigslist.  I downloaded data from craigslist and used it to train a machine learning model using sci-kit learn.  I used to python's pickle module to save this model and implemented as an API using flask.  I then used docker to containerize the application and deploy it on an AWS EC2 instance.
